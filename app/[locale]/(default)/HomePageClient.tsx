  {
    question: "Is this really free to use?",
    answer: "Yes â€“ completely free! You can upload photos and try on as many hair colors as you want without paying. We want everyone to enjoy experimenting with their look. (In the future, we may offer optional premium features, but trying colors will stay free.)"
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to download an app or create an account?",
    answer: "Nope. The hair color changer works entirely online in your web browser. No downloads, no sign-ups, no fuss. Just head to our website and start transforming your hair in photos. It works on mobile devices and computers alike."
  },
  {
    question: "How realistic are the results?",
    answer: "Our tool uses advanced AI similar to the tech behind professional photo editors, so the results are very realistic. It maps the new color onto your hair while respecting lighting, shadows, and hair texture. That means if you have highlights or curls, those details show through the new color naturally. Many users say the edited photos look like they actually dyed their hair!"
  },
  {
    question: "Can I try on any hair color?",
    answer: "Pretty much! We offer a wide range of preset colors from natural tones to vivid fantasy colors. If you have something specific in mind, use our Custom Color feature or type a color prompt (for example, \"rose gold\" or \"mint green\"). The AI will generate that shade for you. So whether it's trending colors or a unique hue, you can likely see it."
  },
  {
    question: "Will the tool change my haircut or just the color?",
    answer: "Just the color. Your hairstyle, length, and everything else remain the same in the photo â€“ we're just digitally \"dyeing\" your hair. This way, the preview focuses on color alone. (If you do want to test new haircuts, stay tuned â€“ we have a virtual hairstyle try-on tool as well!)"
  },
  {
    question: "What types of photos work best?",
    answer: "For best results, use a photo where your hair is clearly visible. It helps if the background contrasts with your hair and the lighting is even (natural daylight is great). Avoid heavily filtered pics or ones where your hair blends into the background. The AI can handle most scenarios, but clear photos will give the most photorealistic outcome. And don't worry â€“ curly, straight, up or down, the tool works on all hair types and styles."
  },
  {
    question: "Is my photo safe?",
    answer: "Absolutely. We do not store your photos permanently or share them. The image is processed to apply the color and then it's gone from our servers. Your privacy is important to us (no sneaky marketing uses or anything). You can experiment freely, knowing your selfies aren't going anywhere beyond this tool."
  },
  {
    question: "I found a color I love â€“ how do I show my hairstylist?",
    answer: "You can download the photo with your chosen color and bring it to your salon, or even share the photo with your hairstylist directly. Having a visual reference of the exact shade you liked (on you) can be super helpful for professionals to replicate that color in real life. It takes out the guesswork when you say \"I want this hair color.\""
  },
  {
    question: "Who is this for?",
    answer: "Anyone who's curious about a new hair color! Our core users are style-savvy individuals (especially young women) who love trying new looks on social media, college students on a budget who want a change, and anyone before a big event (think: \"Should I go brunette for graduation?\"). Even salons could use it to help clients decide. If you have ever thought about changing your hair, this tool is for you. It's like a magic mirror for hair experimentation ðŸ˜Š."
  },
  {
    question: "I'm not very techy â€“ is this hard to use?",
    answer: "Not at all â€“ we built it to be very user-friendly. If you can attach a photo to an email, you have all the skills needed. Just upload a photo and click on colors. There's no manual drawing or editing required. The AI does the complicated stuff, you just enjoy the results."
  },
  {
    question: "Does it work for guys or only long hair?",
    answer: "It works for everyone! Short hair, long hair, any gender â€“ as long as the hair is visible in the photo, the AI will recolor it. We've seen awesome results on pixie cuts, buzz cuts (try our Buzz Cut filter for fun), and even beards. So feel free to try it on any hairstyle."
